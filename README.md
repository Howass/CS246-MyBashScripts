# CS246-MyBashScripts
Good you, find something interesting here aren't you. This is the collection of CS 246 bash scripts I used, I can't share the auto generation of test cases scripts, 
but I've wrote something helpful too. Such as add.sh, will add a new line for all of the files in current directory, which you know school env won't let you compile if you don't have the new line char.
